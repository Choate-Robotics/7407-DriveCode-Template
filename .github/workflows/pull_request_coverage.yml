      # Cache the installation of Poetry itself, e.g. the next step. This prevents the workflow
      # from installing Poetry every time, which can be slow. Note the use of the Poetry version
      # number in the cache key, and the "-0" suffix: this allows you to invalidate the cache
      # manually if/when you want to upgrade Poetry, or if something goes wrong. This could be
      # mildly cleaner by using an environment variable, but I don't really care.

      # Install Poetry. You could do this manually, or there are several actions that do this.
      # `snok/install-poetry` seems to be minimal yet complete, and really just calls out to
      # Poetry's default install script, which feels correct. I pin the Poetry version here
      # because Poetry does occasionally change APIs between versions and I don't want my
      # actions to break if it does.
      #
      # The key configuration value here is `virtualenvs-in-project: true`: this creates the
      # venv as a `.venv` in your testing directory, which allows the next step to easily
      # cache it.
